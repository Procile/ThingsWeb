## Cloning
Cloning ThingsWeb is as simple as running `git clone`, and then the link to the repository :
```sh
sudo git clone https://github.com/Degen-dev/Degeneracy](https://github.com/Darkness-Organization/Neb)
```
## Installing Dependencies
Go inside the CD :
```
cd Neb/
```
Install npm i :
```
npm i
```
## Starting the Site
See the command below:
```sh
$ npm start
```

Assuming the site does not include a start script, you will have to find the index file manually. In general, the file name will be something along the lines of `main.js`, `index.js` or `start.js`. To run the file, simply run the following command:
```sh
$ node {filename}.js
```

Be sure to exclude the curly brackets and change `filename` to the actual name of the file you are trying to run.
